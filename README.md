### Vector Mathematics System (Offline 3)
**File**: `02_Offline_Assignments/Offline_3/2005107.cpp`

A comprehensive C++ implementation of 3D vector mathematics featuring:

#### Features
- ‚úÖ **Dynamic Memory Management** - Proper allocation/deallocation for vector names
- ‚úÖ **Operator Overloading** - Complete set of mathematical operators
- ‚úÖ **Cross Product Calculation** - 3D vector cross product implementation
- ‚úÖ **Component-wise Operations** - Element-by-element vector operations
- ‚úÖ **Scalar Multiplication** - Both `vector * scalar` and `scalar * vector`
- ‚úÖ **Stream Output** - Formatted vector display with mathematical notation

#### Supported Operations
```cpp
Vector v1("v1", 1, 2, 3);
Vector v2("v2", 4, 5, -6);

// Cross product
Vector v3 = v1 ^ v2;

// Equality comparison
if (v1 == v2) { /* ... */ }

// Scalar multiplication
v1 = v1 * 2;        // vector * scalar
v2 = 2 * v2;        // scalar * vector

// Component-wise multiplication
Vector v4 = v1 * v2;
```

#### Output Format
```
v1: 1x+2y+3z
v2: 4x+5y-6z
Result1: -27x+18y-3z
